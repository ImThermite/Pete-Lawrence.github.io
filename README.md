# Tekken-Gamepad
Tekken skin for Mr McPowned's Gamepad Viewer by [Peter Lawrence](https://steamcommunity.com/id/PeterLawrence/)

This skin supports all built-in button macros for Tekken.

Gamepad Viewer is for OBS. Create a CLR Browser source and paste the URL there.

## Here are two common configurations. (WIP)
* [Completely default Tekken, R1 is Rage Art, all other buttons disabled](https://gamepadviewer.com/?p=1&css=https%3A%2F%2Fpete-lawrence.github.io%2Ftekken.css&map=%7B%22mapping%22%3A%5B%7B%22targetType%22%3A%22buttons%22%2C%22target%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22disabled%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%7B%22targetType%22%3A%22buttons%22%2C%22target%22%3A%2210%22%2C%22disabled%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%7B%22targetType%22%3A%22buttons%22%2C%22target%22%3A%228%22%2C%22disabled%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%7B%22targetType%22%3A%22buttons%22%2C%22target%22%3A%229%22%2C%22disabled%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%7B%22targetType%22%3A%22buttons%22%2C%22target%22%3A%227%22%2C%22disabled%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%7B%22targetType%22%3A%22buttons%22%2C%22target%22%3A%226%22%2C%22disabled%22%3Atrue%7D%2C%7B%22targetType%22%3A%22buttons%22%2C%22target%22%3A%224%22%2C%22disabled%22%3Atrue%7D%5D%7D)
